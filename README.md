# GitHub Setup and Practice Assignment
This assignment involves multiple steps and will possibly use unfamiliar terminology. Go slowly, read and follow instructions carefully, and you will be alright!


**(10 points) Assignment Instructions**

1. Create your own GitHub profile/ID (very useful to include on job or graduate school applications)  
2. Create a new repository, known as a repo, for practice
   - Find a green "New" button and add a repository
   - You can provide it any name you choose
   - Keep the repo public
   - Initialize it with a "REAMDE" file
3. Create a copy of Dr. Phadke's STAT184WC-FA24_GitHub-Practice repo
   - Go to the link where these instructions are located
   - Look for a "View on GitHub" button somewhere on this page OR just search GitHub for "sayaliph" and find the repo from among the list of repositories
   - "Fork" Dr. Phadke's assignment repo to create your own copy to edit
   - Your copy of the repo should say "[your-userID] / STAT184WC-FA24_GitHub-Practice" at the top with a tiny note saying it was forked from sayaliph
   - Click on the "README.md" > click Edit button (pencil icon in upper right) to edit your copy of the repo
   - Scroll to the bottom of the document
4. **Add a row** in the table below with your information 
    - Follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (next to the "]" key)... use the "Sayali Phadke" row as a template
    - (2 points) first & last name  
    - (2 points) class section
    - (2 points) github id (you chose this when creating your profile)
    - (2 points) url for GitHub repo you created in Step 2
    - (2 points) commit your changes and submit a pull request
        - Click on the green "Commit changes" button
            - Write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Sayali Phadke to class table")
            - Push the commit to the "Master branch..."
            - Click green button "Commit file change"
5. Merge your updated copy of the repo with Dr. Phadke's repo
    - Click on "Pull requests" at the top of the page >> click green button "New Pull Request"
    - GitHub will take you to MY (Dr. Phadke's) copy of the repo (sayaliph / STAT184WC-FA24_GitHub-Practice) at the top
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Describe the change again (e.g. "added Sayali Phadke to class table")
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Job done!
6. (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
 
**Important**: Your entry may NOT appear on the class table right away. Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
